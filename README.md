# You're at commit 'first commit'
This project uses unocss + vueprime, the purpose is to have unocss to do any extra styles on pages + any hand-crafted components etc..
Vueprime will be used on other parts of this app with its original styles.

This should work run ``bun run dev`` to view the app in the browser there is a vueprime button that shows a toast, great!.

checkout the 'second commit' `git log --oneline` when we used the tailwind preflight and all vueprime styes were broken.
